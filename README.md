IRONHACK RUN: A 2D Side Crawler Game
IRONHACK RUN is an exciting 2D side crawler game that I developed during my time at the Ironhack bootcamp. In this game, players take on the role of a brave hero tasked with defeating COVID bacteria, fighting a villan and saving the world.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the P5.js library, I created a visually appealing and interactive game environment. Players can jump and shoot projectiles to eliminate COVID bacteria as they progress through three challenging levels.

The game features smooth animations, responsive controls, and engaging gameplay mechanics. Players must navigate through platforms, avoid obstacles, and strategically defeat COVID bacteria using their shooting abilities. Each level becomes progressively more difficult, culminating in an epic boss battle at the end.

The visual design, implemented with CSS, adds vibrancy and excitement to the game, immersing players in a world filled with infectious challenges.
